1.0.0   2021-06-05
   [Changed]
     - Ported module Rex::Ext::TemplateToolkit from rex-recipes to CPAN
       and renamed it to Rex::Template::TT (overwriting the original, less
       feature-rich version by Jan Gehring -- with his permission)
     - Abort processing on error (instead of logging an error and continuing)
   [Fixed]
     - Syntax error in match operator ('~=' instead of '=~')
     - Don't try to resolve scalar refs passed into `template_toolkit()` to
       on-disk paths (they are meant to provide template content in-memory)
   [Added]
     - GitHub Actions based Continuous Integration
     - Tests for `template_toolkit()` and integration with Rex's `template()`
